# TF UI Concept

This is a quick concept piece to showcase a UI idea I had. The code is *not* pretty, as I was focused on expedience to get feedback on an idea. There's a lot of really bad practices here.

This can be found on Vercel here.

### Requirements

We need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts.

## Install and run

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. <br> Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |
